This dataset tracks wins and losses in real-time during a live event, the tournament director enters the results to a web-based system. Each event has a unique ID, as well as an overall series ID.

An example of a weekly results can be found at https://matchplay.events/live/z8e73/standings
An example of tournament standings can be found at https://matchplay.events/live/series/2291
Execute the following steps to build a Power BI based solution to make the club's tournament data more accessible:

Create a Shared Workspace in Microsoft Power BI Online Service
Connect to website data tables using the custom ID parameter and perform data cleaning before loading into a Power BI model
Create additional measures/calculations, and organize so reports, dashboards and other visualization components can be accomplished
Create a variety of visualizations to meet the needs of three user groups:
Tournament Organizers
Event Participants
Public Visitors/Followers
Display the visualizations in report pages per user group requirements
Create interactive dashboards to drill down into the data
Player performance over time including weekly and series total points
Week over week deltas including number of participants
Publish the reports to a Microsoft Power BI Online Service Shared Workspace – along with the necessary access/sharing privileges and security
Configure an automatic refresh so as additional weeks are completed, the model can be refreshed to absorb the new data and be reflected in the reports
League Data
After each weekly event the tournament director collects and uploads results data to a web-based system located at http://cffc.league.papa.org/#league7. In this part of the exercise, determine the best way to connect to this data with Power BI. Extract, transform, and load the raw data into the model for further analysis:

Create a Shared Workspace in Microsoft Power BI Online Service
Establish a secure location for the import of data (if necessary)
Connect to data (either via web page, database, or offline excel files stored on a shared location), and perform data cleaning before loading into a Power BI model
Create a parameter entry box to specify a particular league season
Transform the data, create additional measures/calculations, and organize so reports, dashboards and other visualization components can be accomplished
Create a variety of visualizations to meet the needs of three user groups:
League Organizers
Event Participants
Public Visitors/Followers
Display the visualizations in report pages per user group requirements
Create interactive dashboards to drill down into the data
Scores and performance over time for each machine and player
Total points per participant over time to measure progress on the season/series
Publish the reports to a Microsoft Power BI Online Service Shared Workspace – along with the necessary access/sharing privileges and security
Create an automated data flow so as additional weeks are completed, the model can be refreshed to absorb the new data and be reflected in the reports
Additional Considerations
Use deployment pipelines for development, testing and production environments (optional/additional considerations))
Use AI features to predict trends and forecasting (optional/additional considerations)
Create a paginated report for each week (optional/additional considerations)
Automate email template to participants/organizers with results and updates
Organizers and participants of the event would like to analyze the following data:
Total number of players
Number of weeks each participant has completed
Position and total points of each participant over time
Average score, highest score, lowest score and total number of plays per machine
Average score, highest score, lowest score and total number of plays per participant
Player progress over time – which player(s) have made the most improvement week after week
Dashboard for each participant to see their results over time
Dashboard that displays cumulative season metrics
